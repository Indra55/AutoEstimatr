## Features

- Predict car prices based on features such as make, model, year, fuel type, and kilometers driven.
- Built on a cleaned dataset for improved accuracy and reliability.
- Simple linear regression implementation for straightforward predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for implementation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizations of data and results.
- **Scikit-learn**: For linear regression and model evaluation.
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading the trained model.

## Data Preparation

1. The dataset is cleaned to remove missing values and outliers.
2. Categorical features (e.g., company, fuel type) are transformed using **One-Hot Encoding** to prepare for linear regression.
3. The dataset is split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split to evaluate the model's performance.

## Model Training

The model is trained using the following steps:

1. Load the cleaned dataset.
2. Prepare the feature matrix `X` and target variable `Y`.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Create and train the linear regression model.
5. Save the trained model using `pickle`.

## Usage

To use the car price prediction model:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required packages.
3. Load the trained model and input your car features for prediction.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the R² score, which indicates how well the model explains the variance in car prices. Higher R² scores indicate better model performance.

## Future Enhancements

- Explore additional regression techniques, such as Ridge or Lasso regression, to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Implement cross-validation for more robust model evaluation.
- Create an interactive web application using Flask or Django for user-friendly predictions.
